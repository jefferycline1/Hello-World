# Hello-World
I am working on a solo project for some songs i've put together. This project (web site) will help to keep my music organized and add structure for future music production and creation.
My name is Jeffery Cline I live in lexington,KY Ive been fasinated by music since I was 8. Ive been studying or playing in a band or in the studio. It is my passion im 43 years old and i cant think of anything other than software development  I would consider learning. IM hoping that through this process i can have a better understanding of the process for creating something from a vision. In this process I hope to also be able to design software/app that can assist Guitarists or musicians create music and write songs.
